# Water-Physics
Tried to make a water physics simulation.

**I also made the video showing the process:**


## Controls:
Press <Down>/<Up> to change the speed.

Press **Q** to change the current block.

Press **W** to remove the walls.

Press **E** to remove the water.

Press **R** to clear the map.

Press **Left mouse button** to place a block.

Press **Right mouse button** to delete a block.


You can change "Map.png" in the "Resources/Images" directory. It will change the initial state of the map.

Blue pixel (RGB: 0, 0, 255) represents water.

White pixel (RGB: 255, 255, 255) represents a wall.

Any other pixel represents nothing.

## Source code?
I'll upload it whenever I can.
